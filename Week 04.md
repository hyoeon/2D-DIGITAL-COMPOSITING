__1. Merge__  
- atop (Ab+B(1-a)) : Shows the shape of image B, with A covering B where the images overlap.  
- average ((A+B)/2) : The average of the two images. The result is darker than the original images.  
- color-burn (darken B towards A) : Image B gets darker based on the luminance of A.  
- color-dodge (brighten B towards A) : Image B gets brighter based on the luminance of A.  
- conjoint-over (A+B(1-a/b), A if a>b) : Similar to the over operation, except that if a pixel is partially covered by both A and B, conjoint-over assumes A completely hides B. For instance, two polygons where A and B share some edges but A completely overlaps B. Normal over produces a slightly transparent seam here.  
- copy (A) : Only shows image A.  
- difference (abs(A-B)) : How much the pixels differ. Also available from Merge > Merges > Absminus.  
- disjoint-over (A+B(1-a)/b, A+B if a+b<1) : Similar to the over operation, except that if a pixel is partially covered by both a and b, disjoint-over assumes the two objects do not overlap. For instance, two polygons that touch and share an edge. Normal over produces a slightly transparent seam here.
- divide (A/B, 0 if A<0 and B<0) : Divides the values but stops two negative values from becoming a positive number.  
- exclusion (A+B-2AB) : A more photographic form of difference.  
- from : (B-A) : Image A is subtacted from B.  
- geometric (2AB/(A+B)) : Another way of averaging two images.  
- hard-light (multiply if A<0.5, screen if A>0.5) : Image B is lit up by a very bright and sharp light in the shape of image A.  
- hypot (sqrt(A*A+B*B)) : Resembles the plus and screen operations. The result is not as bright as plus, but brighter than screen. Hypot works with values above 1.  
- in (Ab) : Only shows the areas of image A that overlap with the alpha of B. Also available from Merge > Merges > In.  
- mask (Ba) : This is the reverse of the in operation. Only shows the areas of image B that overlap with the alpha of A.  
- matte (Aa+B(1-a)) : Premultiplied over. Use unpremultiplied images with this operation. Also available from Merge > Merges > Matte.  
- max (max (A,B)) : Takes the maximum values of both images. Also available from Merge > Merges > Max.  
- min (min (A,B)) : Takes the minimum values of both images. Also available from Merge > Merges > Min.  
- minus (A-B) : Image B is subtracted from A.  
- multiply (AB, A if A<0 and B<0) : Multiplies the values but stops two negative values from becoming a positive number. Also available from Merge > Merges > Multiply.  
- out (A(1-b)) : Only shows the areas of image A that do not overlap with the alpha of B. Also available from Merge > Merges > Out.  
- over (A+B(1-a)) : This is the default operation. Layers image A over B according to the alpha of image A.  
- overlay (multiply if B<0.5, screen if B>0.5) : Image A brightens image B.  
- plus (A+B) : The sum of image A and B. Also available from Merge > Merges > Plus. Note that the plus algorithm may result in pixel values higher than 1.0.  
- screen (A or B â‰¤1? A+B-AB: max(A,B)) : If A or B is less than or equal to 1 the screen else use the maximum example, resembles Plus. Also available from Merge > Merges > Screen.  
- soft-light (B(2A+(B(1-AB))) if AB<1, 2AB otherwise) : Image B gets lit up. Not as extreme as the hard-light operation.  
- stencil (B(1-a)) : This is the reverse of the out operation. Only shows the areas of image B that do not overlap with the alpha of A.    
- under (A(1-b)+B) : This is the reverse of the over operation. Layers image B over A according to the matte of image B.  
- xor (A(1-b)+B(1-a)) : Shows both image A and B where the images do not overlap.
